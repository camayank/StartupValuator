Correct Prompt and Sequential Workflow
Objective: Build industry-specific valuation models that dynamically appear based on user selections (industry and segment). These models will use predefined variables tailored for each industry and segment while maintaining a user-friendly workflow, as discussed earlier. The workflow will include login, a landing page, and a step-by-step valuation process with intuitive card-based navigation.

Prompt for Industry-Specific Models and Workflow
High-Level Prompt:
"Create a valuation tool where users first select their industry and segment. Based on the selection, dynamically display relevant variables for input, tailored to the chosen industry. Use a card-based step-by-step workflow for ease of use, including:

Business Information
Industry-Specific Variables
Financial Information
Valuation Method Selection
Review and Generate Report."
Sequential Workflow
1. User Login and Landing Page
Prompt:
"Design a login system with Google and email sign-in options. Upon login, direct users to a professional landing page that highlights the tool’s key features and includes links to:
Start Valuation
Subscription Plans
User Dashboard (saved reports, past valuations)."
2. Step 1: Business Information
Prompt:
"Collect basic business information:
Business Name
Purpose of Valuation (Dropdown: Fundraising, M&A, ESOPs, etc.)
Region of Operation (Dropdown: India, US, UK, etc.)
Business Stage (Dropdown: Ideation, Growth, Scaling, Mature)."
3. Step 2: Industry-Specific Variables
Dynamic Workflow Based on Industry Selection:
Industry Dropdown Options: SaaS, E-commerce, Manufacturing, Healthcare, etc.
Prompt for SaaS Industry:
"What is your monthly recurring revenue (MRR)?"
"What is your customer acquisition cost (CAC)?"
"What is your churn rate (percentage)?"
Prompt for E-commerce Industry:
"What is your average order value (AOV)?"
"What is your conversion rate (percentage)?"
"What is your inventory turnover ratio?"
Prompt for Healthcare Industry:
"What is your average revenue per patient?"
"What percentage of your revenue is recurring?"
"What is the total addressable market (TAM) for your specialization?"
4. Step 3: Financial Information
Prompt:
"Capture core financial metrics:
Annual Revenue
Revenue Growth Rate
Operating Margins
Current and Projected Cash Flow."
5. Step 4: Valuation Method Selection
Prompt:
"Display recommended valuation methods based on industry and segment:
SaaS: DCF, ARR Multiples
E-commerce: Market Multiples, Revenue-Based
Healthcare: Asset-Based, Market Comparables
Let users select a method, with a tooltip or guide explaining each method."
6. Step 5: Review and Generate Report
Prompt:
"Display a summary of inputs and assumptions, with options to edit any field dynamically.
Include real-time recalculations for changes.
Allow users to customize the report format (PDF/Excel) and branding (logo, colors)."
Backend Logic for Industry-Specific Models
Predefined Models:

Create a library of valuation models for each industry using parameters like:
SaaS: MRR, churn rate, LTV/CAC ratio.
E-commerce: AOV, conversion rates, inventory turnover.
Manufacturing: Asset values, production capacity, operating margins.
Link each model to backend logic tailored to the chosen valuation methods.
Dynamic Variable Display:

Use conditional logic to display only the variables relevant to the selected industry and segment.
Real-Time Calculations:

Backend logic should adjust valuation results dynamically based on user inputs and external data (e.g., market benchmarks).
Login and Landing Page Workflow
Login Page
Google and email login options.
Redirect to the Landing Page post-login.
Landing Page
Sections:
Hero Section: "Discover Your Startup’s True Value – Fast and Easy."
Features: List industry-specific models, compliance-ready reports, and AI-powered insights.
Call-to-Actions:
"Start Your Valuation Now" (Redirects to Step 1).
"Explore Subscription Plans" (Redirects to pricing page).
UI Enhancements
Card-Based Workflow:

Display each step as a clickable card (e.g., Business Info → Industry Variables → Financials → Valuation Method → Review).
Highlight the active step with progress indicators.
Tooltips and Guidance:

Provide brief, inline tooltips explaining each input field.
Add "Learn More" links for complex terms or methods.
Minimalistic Design:

Clean UI with ample whitespace.
Use consistent color schemes and typography for a professional look.
