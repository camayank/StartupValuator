Final Outcome: Comprehensive Valuation Report

Key Elements:

1. Executive Summary: Snapshot, valuation range, risks, and growth projections.


2. Company Analysis: Business model, team, product maturity.


3. Market Analysis: TAM, SAM, SOM, competitive analysis.


4. Financial Analysis: Metrics, projections, and cash flow.


5. Valuation Analysis: Valuation methods, sensitivity analysis.


6. Risk Assessment: Risks and mitigation.


7. Growth Opportunities: Expansion and strategic recommendations.


8. Investment Considerations: Funding requirements, ROI, and exit strategies.


9. Appendices: Detailed data, financial models, benchmarks.

Backward Steps: Breaking It Down into Input Screens

Step 1: Input Screens to Capture Core Data

1. Business Profile Screen

Inputs:

Business Name

Sector & Industry

Revenue Model (Dropdown: Subscription, Transaction Fee, etc.)

Product Stage (Dropdown: Concept, MVP, Growth, Scaling)

Team Size and Experience

Geographic Markets (Local, National, Global)


Purpose: Populate company overview in the report.

Validation: Mandatory fields, dropdown selections.



2. Market Information Screen

Inputs:

TAM, SAM, SOM (Numerical Inputs with tooltips)

Market Growth Rate (Numerical %)

Competitor Names (Textbox with examples)

Competitive Advantages (Textarea)


Purpose: Populate market size, competitive landscape, and growth analysis.

Validation: Validate numerical ranges (e.g., TAM > SAM > SOM).



3. Financial Data Screen

Inputs:

Revenue (Current and Forecasted)

Burn Rate & Runway (Numerical Inputs)

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) & Lifetime Value (LTV)

Monthly Active Users (MAU) or User Growth


Purpose: Populate financial metrics and growth projections.

Validation: Ensure positive values, logical relations (e.g., LTV > CAC).



4. Product Analysis Screen

Inputs:

Product Name and Description

Product Maturity (Dropdown: Concept, MVP, Fully Developed)

Key Features or Differentiators (Textarea)

Technology Stack (Textarea)


Purpose: Populate product/service analysis and innovation score.

Validation: Ensure text areas are not empty.



5. Risk Assessment Screen

Inputs:

Identify Key Risks (Dropdown: Market, Technology, Execution, Financial, Regulatory)

Current Mitigation Strategies (Textarea)


Purpose: Populate risk assessment section.

Validation: Ensure at least one risk is identified.



6. Valuation Inputs Screen

Inputs:

Exit Valuation Target (Numerical Input)

Discount Rate (Numerical Input)

Risk Adjustment Factors (Dropdown: Low, Moderate, High)

Benchmark Comparisons (Dropdown or Preloaded)


Purpose: Populate valuation calculations using multiple methods.

Validation: Ensure logical values (e.g., discount rate < 100%).

Step 2: Logic & Data Processing

1. Data Validation Logic

Ensure consistency and completeness of inputs.

Validate relationships between inputs (e.g., CAC < LTV).



2. Dynamic Calculations

TAM/SAM/SOM breakdown.

Financial metrics like unit economics and profitability timelines.

Risk-adjusted valuation calculations.



3. AI-Powered Insights

Use OpenAI API for generating competitive analysis, risk mitigations, and valuation range insights.

Process user inputs into concise summaries and actionable insights.





---

Step 3: Interactive Features

Real-time Validation: Highlight incomplete or inconsistent fields.

Progress Bar: Indicate completion percentage across input screens.

Save and Continue: Allow users to save progress and resume.

Execution Plan for Next 30 Minutes

1. Build Input Screens in Replit

Use React.js or similar frameworks for structured form screens:

Screen 1: Business Profile Form

Screen 2: Market Information Form

Screen 3: Financial Data Form

Screen 4: Product Analysis Form

Screen 5: Risk Assessment Form

Screen 6: Valuation Inputs Form


2. Implement Backend API Logic

Endpoints:

/api/validate: Validate user inputs dynamically.

/api/calculate: Perform calculations for TAM, valuation, etc.

/api/generate: Generate final valuation report.



3. AI Integration

Use OpenAI prompts to generate:

Competitive Analysis.

Risk Mitigation Strategies.

Valuation Ranges.



4. Report Generation

Dynamic Templates:

Use a report generator (e.g., jsPDF) for PDF creation.

Include charts (TAM growth, valuation methods comparison).
