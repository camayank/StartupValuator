Objective: Provide a detailed breakdown of key valuation methods, their inputs, and how to automate and refine them for the tool.

1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method
Purpose:
Valuates a business based on the present value of its future cash flows, adjusted for risk using a discount rate.

Inputs Required:

Projected Cash Flows:
Can be AI-generated if not provided, based on revenue, growth rate, and margins.
Discount Rate (WACC):
Incorporate risk-free rate, market risk premium, and industry beta.
Terminal Value:
Use perpetual growth or exit multiple methods.
Dynamic Backend Logic:

Fetch industry benchmarks for growth rates and margins if projections are missing.
Calculate WACC dynamically:
Region-specific risk-free rate (via APIs).
Market risk premium (e.g., US: historical 5-6%, India: 6-7%).
Automate terminal value calculation:
Use perpetual growth formula:
Terminal Value
=
FCF
𝑛
+
1
Discount Rate
−
Growth Rate
Terminal Value= 
Discount Rate−Growth Rate
FCF 
n+1

Outputs:

Present value of cash flows.
Sensitivity curves showing impact of growth rate and discount rate variations.
2. Market Multiples Method
Purpose:
Compare the business to similar companies in the same industry.

Inputs Required:

Revenue or EBITDA: Key financial metric.
Multiples:
Revenue multiple (e.g., SaaS: 8x-12x ARR).
EBITDA multiple (e.g., Manufacturing: 6x-10x EBITDA).
Dynamic Backend Logic:

Fetch real-time multiples from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Crunchbase).
Adjust multiples based on company-specific factors:
Higher growth → premium multiple.
Higher risk → discount to the median multiple.
Calculate valuation:
Valuation
=
Metric (e.g., EBITDA)
×
Multiple
Valuation=Metric (e.g., EBITDA)×Multiple.
Outputs:

Comparisons with multiple peers.
Graph showing the range of valuations (low, median, high).
3. Precedent Transactions
Purpose:
Determine valuation by comparing to similar companies recently acquired or funded.

Inputs Required:

Industry and segment details.
Comparable transaction data.
Dynamic Backend Logic:

Fetch recent transaction data (e.g., Crunchbase, PitchBook).
Adjust for transaction date and size:
Older transactions → discount for time.
Larger transactions → adjust for scalability premium.
Calculate implied valuation:
Valuation
=
Comparable Metric
×
Adjusted Multiple
Valuation=Comparable Metric×Adjusted Multiple.
Outputs:

Table of comparable transactions.
Adjusted range of valuations.
4. Asset-Based Valuation
Purpose:
Determine valuation based on net asset value (NAV).

Inputs Required:

Value of assets (current or projected).
Liabilities.
Dynamic Backend Logic:

Auto-fetch asset values if linked to accounting systems (e.g., QuickBooks).
Adjust for depreciation or appreciation based on asset type.
Calculate NAV:
NAV
=
Assets
−
Liabilities
NAV=Assets−Liabilities.
Outputs:

Asset breakdown by type.
NAV-based valuation report.
5. Income Capitalization Method
Purpose:
Valuates the business by capitalizing expected annual income.

Inputs Required:

Net Operating Income (NOI).
Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate).
Dynamic Backend Logic:

Fetch average cap rates by industry and region.
Adjust for specific risk factors:
Higher stability → lower cap rate.
Calculate valuation:
Valuation
=
NOI
Cap Rate
Valuation= 
Cap Rate
NOI
​
 .
Outputs:

NOI breakdown.
Valuation based on cap rate variations.
Refined Dynamic Risk Adjustment Logic
Objective: Accurately incorporate qualitative inputs into quantitative models to reflect real-world risks.

Qualitative Inputs and Their Impact
Team Experience:

Higher experience → lower risk premium.
Impact: Adjusts discount rate in DCF or increases multiple in Market Multiples.
Regulatory Compliance:

Compliant businesses → lower risk premium.
Non-compliance → add penalties or reduce valuation.
Market Competition:

Highly competitive market → increase risk premium.
Dominant player → premium valuation.
Customer Concentration:

Dependence on a single client → higher risk premium.
Diverse customer base → lower risk.
Backend Workflow for Risk Logic
Scorecard for Risk Factors:

Each qualitative factor is scored (e.g., 1-5) based on inputs.
Aggregate score determines adjustment to discount rates or multiples.
Dynamic Risk Integration:

High risk → increase discount rate in DCF or reduce multiples.
Low risk → apply valuation premium.
Real-Time Adjustments:

If user updates qualitative inputs, recalculate valuation dynamically.
