Backend Logic
1. Risk Quantification
Dynamic Risk Premium Adjustment:

Add risk premiums based on industry, stage, and user-provided inputs.
Example: For a volatile cash flow profile, increase discount rate by 2%.
AI Risk Detection:

Auto-detect risks using external data (e.g., regulatory changes, market volatility).
Example: “Recent tax policy changes in India increase regulatory risk.”
2. Scenario Generation
Generate scenarios by varying:
Growth rates (e.g., ±10% around the input value).
Discount rates (e.g., ±2% around WACC).
Terminal value growth rates (e.g., 1-5% based on industry).
3. Sensitivity Models
Monte Carlo Simulation:

Simulate thousands of possible outcomes by randomly varying key inputs.
Output: Probabilistic valuation range (e.g., $10M-$15M with a 90% confidence interval).
Spider and Tornado Analysis:

Analyze which variables have the largest impact on valuation.

1. Risk Section
Visuals:
Radar chart showing risk profile.
Table summarizing identified risks with their mitigation suggestions.
Example:
“The business faces moderate regulatory risk due to recent changes in data privacy laws.”
2. Scenario Comparison
Visuals:
Bar graph comparing best, base, and worst-case valuations.
Example:
“In the base-case scenario, the valuation is $12M. Under the best-case scenario, it rises to $15M.”
3. Sensitivity Section
Visuals:
Sensitivity curves showing valuation impact across key variables.
Example:
“A 1% increase in the discount rate reduces valuation by $500K.”
Enhanced User Experience
1. Interactive Features
Allow users to:
Manually tweak variables and instantly see valuation changes.
Export sensitivity analysis data for further review.
2. Clear Communication
Avoid technical jargon by providing plain-language explanations.
Example: “This analysis shows how your valuation changes with small shifts in growth rate or costs.”
3. AI Recommendations
Generate automated recommendations:
“Focus on improving cash flow stability to reduce financial risk.”
“Consider mitigating market risk by diversifying your product portfolio.”
