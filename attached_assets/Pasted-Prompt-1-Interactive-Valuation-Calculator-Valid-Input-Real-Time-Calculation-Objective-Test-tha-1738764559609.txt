Prompt 1: Interactive Valuation Calculator – Valid Input & Real-Time Calculation
Objective:
Test that all fields on the Interactive Valuation Calculator screen accept valid inputs, trigger real-time calculations, and update visualizations accordingly. Ensure that tooltips and accessibility features (like high contrast mode) function as expected.

Steps to Execute:

Launch & Inspect the Screen:

Open the Interactive Valuation Calculator (file: InteractiveValuationCalculator.tsx) in your Replit environment.
Verify that the following fields are visible:
Annual Revenue (numeric input with currency formatting)
Currency Selection (options include USD, EUR, GBP)
Growth Rate (percentage)
Operating Margins (percentage)
Sector Selection (dropdown or selection field)
Business Stage (dropdown or selection field)
Input Valid Data:

Annual Revenue: Enter 1,000,000 (ensure the input accepts only numeric values with proper currency formatting).
Currency Selection: Select USD from the available options.
Growth Rate: Input 10% (ensure the value is within the allowed range, e.g., -100% to 1000%).
Operating Margins: Input 15% (within the allowed range of -100% to 100%).
Sector Selection: Choose an appropriate sector (e.g., "Technology").
Business Stage: Select a stage that matches the business profile (e.g., "Growth Stage").
Verify Field Validations:

Confirm that all required fields are filled.
Check that the numeric fields enforce the correct range validations (no error messages should appear since all values are within acceptable limits).
Ensure the currency format is applied correctly to the Annual Revenue input.
Test Real-Time Calculations & Visualizations:

As you input or modify any of the above values, observe that:
The real-time calculation logic updates the underlying valuation metrics immediately.
Both Bar and Pie chart visualizations update dynamically to reflect the new data.
Make a small change (for example, change the Growth Rate from 10% to 12%) and verify that the charts and calculated outputs adjust instantly.
Check Tooltip Explanations:

Hover your mouse over each field.
Confirm that each hover card tooltip appears and displays detailed explanations (e.g., for Annual Revenue, the tooltip might read: “Enter your annual revenue in the selected currency. Use numeric values only.”).
Test Accessibility Features (High Contrast Mode):

Locate and toggle the High Contrast Mode switch.
Verify that:
The entire interface (fields, texts, charts) is legible in high contrast.
All interactive elements retain proper focus states (keyboard navigation should work seamlessly).
Expected Outcomes:

Field Input & Validation:

All fields accept the provided values without triggering any error messages.
Currency formatting is correct, and numeric range validations pass without issues.
Real-Time Calculation & Visuals:

The valuation calculations update immediately when any input changes.
Bar and Pie chart visualizations accurately reflect the new data in real time.
Tooltip & Accessibility:

Hovering over each input field displays clear, contextual tooltips.
High contrast mode ensures all elements remain accessible and visually clear.
This comprehensive prompt helps you ensure that the Interactive Valuation Calculator screen functions robustly under typical user interactions.
