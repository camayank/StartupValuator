“Dynamic Cascading Dropdowns for Business Sector Selection”

Description:
"Create a web-based form using HTML, JavaScript, and JSON (or a lightweight backend like Flask/Node.js) that allows users to select a Business Sector from a dropdown. Based on their selection, the corresponding Industry Segment dropdown should update dynamically, and further, the Sub-Segment dropdown should populate accordingly. The dataset should include at least 350+ unique sector-segment-sub-segment combinations."

Requirements:

Dropdown Structure:

Dropdown 1: Business Sector
Dropdown 2: Industry Segment (populated based on selected sector)
Dropdown 3: Sub-Segment (populated based on selected segment)
Data Handling:

Use a predefined JSON dataset (or a small database) with at least 350+ unique combinations.
Ensure efficient filtering when selecting options.
Functionality:

When the user selects a Business Sector, the Industry Segment dropdown updates accordingly.
Selecting an Industry Segment updates the Sub-Segment dropdown dynamically.
Ensure smooth UX (disable dropdowns until a selection is made).
Tech Stack (Preferred but flexible):

Frontend: HTML, JavaScript (or React if preferred).
Data Storage: JSON file or a simple backend API (Flask/Node.js) if needed.
Optional: Include a submit button that logs the final selection to the console or displays it on the screen.
Performance Considerations:

Ensure that the dropdowns do not reload the page when selecting options.
Optimize for fast filtering with minimal lag.

{
  "Technology & Software": {
    "Enterprise Software": ["ERP", "CRM", "HRM"],
    "Cloud Computing": ["IaaS", "PaaS", "SaaS"]
  },
  "Healthcare & Life Sciences": {
    "Digital Health": ["Telehealth", "Mobile Health", "Health Analytics"],
    "Biotech": ["Gene Therapy", "Molecular Diagnostics", "Bioinformatics"]
  },
  "Financial Technology": {
    "Digital Banking": ["Neo Banking", "Open Banking", "Embedded Finance"],
    "Payments": ["Digital Payments", "Cross-Border Payments", "BNPL"]
  }
}
Expected Output
✅ User selects "Technology & Software" → Dropdown 2 updates with ["Enterprise Software", "Cloud Computing"]
✅ User selects "Cloud Computing" → Dropdown 3 updates with ["IaaS", "PaaS", "SaaS"]
✅ User submits → Logs selection: {Sector: "Technology & Software", Segment: "Cloud Computing", SubSegment: "PaaS"}
