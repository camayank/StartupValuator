To handle industries or cases that fall close to these predefined categories or fall beyond them, you can adopt a **modular and flexible approach**. Here's how you can address such scenarios:

---

### **1. Generalized Framework for "Close to Existing" Industries**
If an industry is closely related to one of the predefined categories, you can:
- **Identify the Overlap:** Assess which metrics from the existing categories are relevant.
- **Customize with Add-Ons:** Add unique metrics or KPIs specific to the new industry.
- **Combine Metrics:** Borrow metrics from multiple related categories if applicable.

#### Example:
- **Industry:** Fintech Lending
   - Close to: Fintech + Banking
   - Metrics: Borrow relevant metrics like Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (Banking) and Transaction Volume (Fintech).
   - Add-ons: Include metrics like Default Rate, Average Loan Size, and Loan Origination Costs.

---

### **2. Framework for "Beyond Defined" Industries**
For industries that don't neatly fit into the predefined categories:
- **Use a Core-Valuation Approach:** Start with universally applicable valuation methods like DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) or Comparables.
- **Explore KPIs Through Consultation:** Identify key business drivers by consulting industry experts or leveraging open-source industry benchmarks.
- **Create an Industry-Specific Template:** Document the insights gained to form a reusable framework.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Start with Generic Metrics:** Use common financial metrics like revenue growth, operating margin, and ROIC as placeholders.
2. **Add Industry-Specific Metrics:** Identify what differentiates the industry.
3. **Test for Relevance:** Validate the new metrics with sample datasets or case studies.

#### Example:
- **Industry:** Space Technology (Beyond Defined)
   - Core Metrics: R&D Expenditure, Project Timeline Adherence.
   - Unique Metrics: Satellite Lifetime, Revenue per Launch, Customer Contracts in Pipeline.

---

### **3. Adaptive AI Prompts**
Your AI model should:
- **Use Default Prompts:** Start with generic valuation prompts for new or undefined industries.
- **Adjust Based on Input:** Dynamically generate follow-up questions to uncover unique metrics.
- **Incorporate Customization:** Allow users to manually add or prioritize metrics not predefined.

#### Prompt Design:
- **Generic Prompt:** "Based on the following business details, suggest relevant valuation metrics: [Input Details]."
- **Follow-Up Prompt:** "For a business in [industry name], what unique KPIs might drive valuation?"

### **4. Dynamic Questionnaire**
If a new industry is not mapped, provide users with a questionnaire to identify the key drivers:
- **Revenue Model:** How does the company generate revenue (e.g., subscription, transactions)?
- **Customer Metrics:** What key metrics define customer success (e.g., retention, CAC)?
- **Operational Efficiency:** What metrics highlight operational success (e.g., cost per unit, uptime)?
- **Industry Trends:** What external factors impact valuation (e.g., regulation, innovation)?

#### Example:
- **Industry:** Artificial Intelligence Services
   - Questionnaire Output:
     - Revenue Model: Subscription + Per-Use Fee.
     - Customer Metrics: MRR, Churn Rate.
     - Operational Metrics: Model Accuracy, Cost per API Call.

---

### **5. Catch-All Category: "Emerging Industries"**
Create an "Emerging Industries" category for industries that don't fit into predefined templates but share common themes like technology, sustainability, or innovation.

#### Approach:
- Use placeholders like:
  - **Revenue Metrics:** Growth Rate, Recurring Revenue.
  - **Cost Metrics:** R&D Spend, Unit Economics.
  - **Market Metrics:** Industry TAM (Total Addressable Market), Customer Penetration.

- Allow manual overrides:
  - Let users adjust metrics or input custom ones for flexibility.

---

### **6. Hybrid Models for Unique Scenarios**
For highly dynamic or niche industries:
- Combine multiple valuation methodologies (e.g., DCF + Precedent Transactions + Innovation Index).
- Highlight qualitative factors like intellectual property, management expertise, or regulatory position.

#### Example:
- **Industry:** Green Hydrogen Production
   - Combine: Renewable Energy (carbon credits) + Utilities (distribution costs).
   - Add Unique Metrics: Hydrogen Yield, Cost per kg, Government Subsidies.

---

### **7. Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**
- Collect feedback from users when they encounter industries not supported or metrics they need.
- Use this feedback to train the AI model to recognize and adapt to similar industries in the future.

---

### **Key Features to Implement**
1. **Custom Input Fields:** Allow users to enter unique metrics manually.
2. **AI Recommendations:** Suggest similar industries or metrics based on input data.
3. **Industry Benchmarking Tool:** Provide a library of metrics/KPIs for reference.
4. **Continuous Learning:** Train the AI to improve by analyzing real-world inputs over time.
