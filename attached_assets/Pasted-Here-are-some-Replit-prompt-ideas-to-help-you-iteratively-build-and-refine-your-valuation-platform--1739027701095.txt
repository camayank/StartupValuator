Here are some Replit prompt ideas to help you iteratively build and refine your valuation platform. You can run these prompts (or adapt them) in Replit’s collaborative coding environment to create modules, test features, and integrate systems:

---

### **Valuation Tools & Analysis**

1. **AI-Powered Valuation Integration:**  
   *Prompt:*  
   > "Set up a basic Python (or Node.js) project on Replit that integrates the OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude APIs. Write sample code to send valuation-related queries and receive real-time responses."

2. **Multi-Step Smart Valuation Wizard:**  
   *Prompt:*  
   > "Create a multi-page React application on Replit that guides users through a valuation process. Include navigation between steps and implement state management to store form data."

3. **Monte Carlo Simulation Module:**  
   *Prompt:*  
   > "Develop a Python script on Replit that performs Monte Carlo simulations for prediction modeling. Include parameters for financial inputs and generate a graphical output (using Matplotlib or Plotly) to visualize the results."

4. **Real-Time Valuation Calculations:**  
   *Prompt:*  
   > "Implement a Node.js or Python backend on Replit that calculates real-time valuations based on dynamic user input. Ensure the system can handle asynchronous requests and update valuations immediately."

### **User Management**

5. **Role-Based Access Control:**  
   *Prompt:*  
   > "Build a simple Express (or FastAPI) backend on Replit that demonstrates role-based access control. Create endpoints for Startup, Investor, Valuer, and Consultant roles and secure them using JWT tokens."

6. **Tiered Subscription Management:**  
   *Prompt:*  
   > "Design a basic tiered subscription management system on Replit. Use a database (like SQLite or MongoDB) to store subscription levels (Free/Basic/Premium/Enterprise) and implement logic that restricts or enables features based on the subscription tier."

7. **Authentication & Authorization System:**  
   *Prompt:*  
   > "Set up an authentication system on Replit using Passport.js (or a similar library) in Node.js. Implement sign-up, login, and token-based session management."

---

### **Business Analysis & Data Processing**

8. **Smart Business Information Collection:**  
   *Prompt:*  
   > "Develop a form-based interface on Replit using React that collects business data. Implement industry and sector classification, and include basic validation logic for key financial metrics."

9. **Comprehensive Validation Framework:**  
   *Prompt:*  
   > "Create a validation module on Replit using Python’s Pydantic or JavaScript’s Yup. Ensure it supports industry-specific validation rules, cross-method checks, and real-time data validation (triggered on form submission or blur events)."

10. **Error Handling and Recovery:**  
    *Prompt:*  
    > "Implement structured error responses in a Replit project. Build a middleware in Node.js (or an exception handler in Python) that logs errors, provides contextual error messages, and suggests basic error recovery steps."

---

### **Reporting & Monitoring**

11. **Automated Report Generation:**  
    *Prompt:*  
    > "Write a script on Replit that automatically generates PDF/HTML reports based on valuation data. Integrate it with a scheduling tool (like Replit’s cron jobs) to run at specified intervals."

12. **System Health Monitoring:**  
    *Prompt:*  
    > "Develop a simple dashboard on Replit that tracks system health metrics (such as performance, error rates, and usage statistics). Use a lightweight backend to serve API endpoints and a frontend (e.g., using Chart.js) to display the data."

13. **Logging and Performance Metrics:**  
    *Prompt:*  
    > "Implement a logging module on Replit that captures error statistics and performance metrics. Integrate it with your backend so that you can visualize logs in a dedicated admin interface."

---

### **Improving Partially Implemented Features**

14. **Enhancing Cross-Field Dependency Validation:**  
    *Prompt:*  
    > "Review the current implementation of cross-field dependency validation in your Replit project. Create additional test cases and expand the validation rules to cover more scenarios."

15. **Refining Error Recovery Workflow:**  
    *Prompt:*  
    > "Audit your error handling module on Replit. Implement an advanced error recovery workflow that not only logs errors but also provides actionable recovery suggestions to users."

16. **Optimizing Performance with Debouncing and Memoization:**  
    *Prompt:*  
    > "Enhance the performance features of your form inputs on Replit. Implement request debouncing and memoization for field validations to improve responsiveness."

---

### **User Experience Enhancements**

17. **Contextual Help System:**  
    *Prompt:*  
    > "Develop a contextual help feature for your valuation platform on Replit. Create tooltips or a side-panel help system in your React app that provides users with guidance based on the current form section."

18. **Improving Section Navigation and Field-Level Error Highlighting:**  
    *Prompt:*  
    > "Enhance your multi-step wizard on Replit by improving section navigation and adding field-level error highlighting. Use React state management to update the UI in real-time as users fix errors."

Each of these prompts is designed to help you tackle a specific component of your platform. You can run them as separate projects or integrate them step-by-step into a larger Replit workspace. Happy coding!
