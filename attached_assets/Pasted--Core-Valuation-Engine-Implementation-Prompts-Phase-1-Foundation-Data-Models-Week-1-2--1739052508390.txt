## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Write unit tests for all calculations
   - Document all assumptions

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Valuation calculation < 5 seconds
   - Monte Carlo simulation < 30 seconds
   - UI updates < 100ms

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for each calculation
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Performance benchmarking
   - User acceptance testing

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Data encryption
   - Input validation
   - Secure calculation methods
   - Audit logging

## Usage Instructions

1. Use each prompt sequentially
2. Include current code context when asking
3. Specify any errors or challenges
4. Request detailed explanations
