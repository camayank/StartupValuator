4. Real Options Valuation (ROV)
Use Case:
Suited for startups with optionality in their business model (e.g., R&D-heavy or expansion plans).
Inputs:
Future project costs and expected returns (AI-predicted if unavailable).
Risk-free rate and volatility (fetched dynamically).
Backend Logic:
Use Black-Scholes or binomial tree methods to compute the value of flexibility in business decisions.
5. Precedent Transactions
Use Case:
Best for businesses planning an exit or acquisition.
Inputs:
Comparable transaction data (e.g., recent acquisitions in the same sector).
Backend Logic:
Fetch and rank transactions by similarity in size, region, and industry.
Adjust for time-related factors like inflation or market changes.
6. Qualitative Valuation Adjustments
Use Case:
Enhances traditional models with qualitative insights.
Inputs:
Team experience, IP protection, and competitive differentiation.
Backend Logic:
Apply qualitative risk premiums or discounts to derived valuations.
Justify adjustments with AI-generated insights.
