Prompt 2: Projections Wizard – Step Navigation, Progress Tracking & PDF Report Generation
Objective:
Validate that the Projections Wizard (file: ProjectionsWizard.tsx) guides users smoothly through all steps of the projection process, accurately tracks progress, and generates a comprehensive PDF report at the end. This prompt also ensures that transitions and animations between steps work correctly.

Steps to Execute:

Launch the Projections Wizard Screen:

Open the Projections Wizard in your Replit environment.
Verify that the initial step (Revenue Projections) is displayed.
Confirm that a visible progress tracker or step indicator shows the current step and the total number of steps (typically 5 steps: Revenue Projections, Expense Planning, Market Validation, Fund Utilization, and Review & Finalize).
Step-by-Step Navigation:

Step 1 – Revenue Projections:

Action: Enter realistic revenue projection values. For instance, input a series of projected revenue figures for the next 5 years.
Validation: Confirm that the input fields enforce numeric-only values and the correct currency format if applicable.
Progress Tracker: Check that the progress indicator highlights the current step correctly.
Transition: Click “Next” or use the provided navigation control to proceed to the next step.
Step 2 – Expense Planning:

Action: Enter key expense data. Ensure that you include all mandatory fields (such as operating expenses, cost of goods sold, etc.).
Validation: Verify any numeric or percentage validations are enforced.
Navigation: Use “Previous” to confirm that you can navigate back to the Revenue Projections step without losing your entered data.
Transition: Navigate forward again.
Step 3 – Market Validation:

Action: Input market validation metrics (e.g., market size, growth trends, or competitor data as required by the form).
Visual Feedback: Ensure that any animations between steps are smooth.
Navigation: Use the step navigation controls to jump between this and adjacent steps, ensuring data persistence.
Step 4 – Fund Utilization:

Action: Enter planned fund utilization details. Include breakdowns if required.
Validation: Check that all validations (e.g., numeric ranges or required fields) trigger appropriately.
Navigation: Verify that you can move back and forth between steps without data loss.
Step 5 – Review & Finalize:

Action: On reaching the final step, review all the entered data.
Validation: Check that the system highlights any missing or inconsistent inputs before final submission.
Transition: Confirm that the review section aggregates data from previous steps in a clear, organized manner.
Progress Tracking & User Feedback:

Action: Throughout the wizard, observe the progress tracker’s responsiveness to your navigation actions.
Expectation: The tracker should update accurately as you move from one step to another (e.g., “Step 3 of 5” should update when you are on the third step).
PDF Report Generation:

Action: At the end of the wizard (Review & Finalize step), trigger the PDF report generation.
Validation:
Ensure that the generated PDF includes data from all previous steps (Revenue Projections, Expense Planning, Market Validation, Fund Utilization).
Verify that the report displays formatted charts, tables, or any visualizations provided in the projections.
Check that the PDF contains all summary data, and that the layout is clear and professional.
Test: Download or preview the PDF report and verify consistency with the on-screen data.
Animations & Transition Effects:

Action: Observe any animations when moving between steps.
Expectation:
Transitions should be smooth with no jarring effects.
All dynamic elements (e.g., fading in/out or sliding transitions) should complete within a reasonable time (e.g., 300–500ms).
Edge Case: Incomplete Data & Error Handling:

Action: On one of the steps (for example, Expense Planning), intentionally leave a required field blank or enter an invalid value.
Expectation:
The system should not allow you to proceed to the next step.
Appropriate error messages should be displayed, guiding you to correct the error before moving on.
Expected Outcomes:

Step Navigation & Progress:

Each step (Revenue Projections, Expense Planning, Market Validation, Fund Utilization, and Review & Finalize) loads correctly with a clear progress indicator.
Navigation between steps (both forward and backward) retains the entered data without loss.
Validations & Error Handling:

Required fields are validated, and any missing or erroneous input prevents progression.
Error messages appear when invalid data is detected, ensuring that users know what to correct.
PDF Report:

Upon finalizing the wizard, a PDF report is generated that accurately compiles data from all steps.
The layout and formatting of the PDF are consistent with the data displayed on the screen.
Smooth Animations & Transitions:

Transitions between steps are animated smoothly.
User experience is enhanced through responsive progress tracking and dynamic visual feedback.
